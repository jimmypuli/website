            Hi, my name is Jimmy Puli. I was born New York City and have cultural ties to Ecuador. I enjoy traveling, being
            productive, and meeting new people. I always prioritize having a good relationship with
            others and using the people around me to bring positive change. Hobbies of mine include
            reading, weightlifting, and making mini projects, hence this website. This website includes videos
            for some of my projects and contact information. Do have a look. Thank you.
