                    <h4>Third Party APIS</h4>
                    Created a server that hosts API request synchronously and preforms face detection. The server
                    handles information from different APIS and user requests. Used streams for file downloading
                    and appropriate headers for multipart/form-data to send images along with API requests. Did 
                    appropriate data parsing and extraction.

                    <h4>Pathfinding Algorithm</h4>
                    Worked with peers for input and advice. I determined the best way to 
                    approach this project. For the fronted, I used HTML to create the grid
                    layout and JavaScript to make the grid elements interactive. CSS was used for styling.
                    For the backend portion, I used JavaScript to make an algorithm that iterates through each grid to 
                    find the possible moves and pick the best move to make. The move is made
                    and the process repeats until we reach the destination.

                    <h4>Space Invaders Game - Python</h4>
                    In this project, I made a 2D game in Python using Pygame. This project
                    took 2 months to complete and is a simple archaic game.
