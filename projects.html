                    <h4>***NEW*** Pathfinding Algorithm</h4>
                    Worked with peers for input and advice. I determined the best way to 
                    approach this project. For the fronted, I used HTML to create the grid
                    layout and JavaScript to make the grid elements interactive. CSS was used for styling.
                    For the backend portion, I used JavaScript to make an algorithm that iterates through each grid to 
                    find the possible moves and pick the best move to make. The move is made
                    and the process repeats until we reach the destination.

                    <h4>Space Invaders Game - Python</h4>
                    In this project, I made a 2D game in Python using Pygame. This project
                    took 2 months to complete and is a simple archaic game.

                    <h4>Data Querying using Docker</h4> 
                    I demonstrate simple data querying using Docker and Azure Data Studio.
                    Working with data is vital today's world where everything is being digitalized. 
                    I look forward to working with data more intensively in the future.

                    <h4>Radix Sorting (C++)</h4>
                    In this video, I go over a program that reads numbers from a text file and 
                    sorts them using the sorting method. The results are then printed to another text 
                    file.

                    <h4>8 Queens(C++)</h4>
                    This program was written as an assignment on my freshman year of college. It is a 
                    popular chessboard problem where a program has to place 8 queens on a chessboard.
